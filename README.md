## Instructions to generate dataset:

First, clone the repository using
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/anonymousgn1/Minecraft.git
```

Now download the required libraries using:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once downloaded all the dependencies, the dataset can be generated by running the following command:

```
python3 main.py projects.csv
```

```projects.csv``` is composed of all open source repositories of multiple languages like C, C++ and Python.

## Extending the dataset
Dataset can be further extended by including different languages. To add languges refer to [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter) library and make the necessary changes in [AST.py](https://github.com/anonymousgn1/Minecraft/blob/main/AST.py).
